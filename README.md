# upassAutomator
A U-Pass Automator that automates the process of requesting a U-Pass every month.

Please note that I wrote this code for my own personal use/convenience. 

### Application Description
The application goes through the U-Pass website and updates my U-Pass given the valid username and password.
After using the program, the user needs to wait for a few days until the U-Pass is approved.

### Dependencies:

`pip3 install selenium`

### Guide:
Inside the program directory, run this following command from the terminal:
`python3 upass.py <username> <password>`

TODO: 
Set up the script to run on the 16th of every month.
